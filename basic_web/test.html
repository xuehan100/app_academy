	  This is some text in a paragraph element. 
	  
	  <span>
	    This text has been styled bold because it is in a span element 
	    that's a child of a paragraph element.
	   </span>
	  
	  <span class="highlight">
	    This text is green because the class selector overrides 
	    the tag selector when multiple style declarations apply to the same
	    attribute (`color`) of the same element. It's still bold though!
	   </span>
