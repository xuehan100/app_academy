	<h2>Directions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			brew your cold brew. 
			<br />
			my ultimate lazy girl cold brew hack is making a batch of cold brew in a french press. you add one cup of fresh coarsely ground coffee to a french press, then you fill it on up with water (about 4 cups, but seriously, who has time to measure these things?). let it sit overnight, then the next morning you’ve got yourself perfect cold brew that took about 2 minutes of active prep time to make.
		</li>

		<li>
			the salted cream cold foam. 
			<br />
			pop some skim milk(!) in a milk frother, with a little bit of salt & a little drizzle of maple for optimal salty-sweetness. i could seriously eat this stuff with my hands – it is SO freakin’ good!
		</li>

		<li>
			you put the whole thing together. 
			<br />
			i add a little salt to my coffee, because my obsession for salty coffee is a little out of control now. & if i’m feeling fancy? a little extra maple syrup.
		</li>
